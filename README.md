Entrepreneurial Design
======================

Entrepreneurial Design provides a real-world setting for students to: launch, iterate, seek out advice and feedback from others, and learn to make their own decisions.

The course takes a broad definition of entrepreneurship (from coffee shops to tech startups), and focuses on the emerging opportunities that come from living and working in an increasingly networked world, while challenging the students to think of themselves not as designers but as creators.

As part of the [School of Visual Arts MFA in Interaction Design Program](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu) curriculum, the course was co-created in 2012 by [Christina Cacioppo](http://christinacacioppo.com) and [Gary Chou](http://garychou.com) and is currently co-taught by [Christina Xu](http://twitter.com/xuhulk), Gary Chou and [Leland Rechis](http://twitter.com/leland).
